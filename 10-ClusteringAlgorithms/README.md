# 10. Clustering Algorithms

- Implement the following on a synthetic 2D dataset with 100 instances each from three Gaussian distributions->

1. K-Means  
2. Single-Linkage Clustering  
3. DBSCAN

## Distributions->  

- Mean = (0, 0), Covariance = diag[4, 9]
- Mean = (5, 5)
- Mean = (9, 9)

## Note: You may modify the mean values to better demonstrate algorithm performance
